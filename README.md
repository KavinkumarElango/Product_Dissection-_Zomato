The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) provides a visual representation of how different components in Zomato’s backend database are connected. Key insights from the ERD:

•	A user can place multiple orders (1-to-many relationship)

•	Each order is associated with multiple items and one restaurant

•	A restaurant can have many menus, orders, and reviews

•	Delivery partners are assigned to multiple orders but only one per order

•	Users can review many restaurants, and restaurants can have many reviews (many-to-many relationship resolved via the Review entity)

📌 The ERD reflects normalization, reducing redundancy while ensuring data integrity across transactional flows.
